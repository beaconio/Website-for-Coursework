						<h3>About Me:</h3>
						<p>My name is Cameron Mukherjee, I am currently 18 years old. I enjoy programming, gaming and learning - from a young age I was always intrigued in computing and technology - which lead me to find my passion for programming - I still remember the first time I accidentally pressed F12 on my keyboard and saw all the code behind the website I was viewing, I was so captivated by the amount I didn't know about the web (which I used almost daily at this age). I personally believe that was the catalyst that started my curiosity in the world of programming and computing. To this day I try and advance my knowledge in computing daily, whether its something small like making a website, creating a server or learning more Python - I try and better myself daily. </p>

								<h3>Education:</h3>
								<p>I am currently studying Interactive Digital Design at 'The Brit School', this includes VFX, Game Development, Web Development and even Graphics Design. During my spare time I independently learn programming lanugages and basic network concepts - I was learning Javascript for a few weeks but soon realised that its very web focused - while I want to learn a more client focused lanugage, this lead me to learning Python and Bash.</p>

								<h3>Where Do I See Myself in 5 Years:</h3>
								<p>Over the next 5 years I am hoping to learn Python completely, and hopefully learn Java too. Then I have the potential to be employeed if I haven't already taken on an apprenticeship (which I hope I do). Somewhere along the line of my career I want to take on a few independent projects, this can include small business' or websites. By 5 years, I am hoping to rather have a stable job as a programmer or cyber security analyst, if not then an independent business.</p>
